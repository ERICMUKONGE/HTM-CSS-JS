      <h1>PEOPLE</h1>
      <p>Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and is 
        consequently relatively young. In some African states, more than half the 
        population is under 25 years of age. The total number of people in 
        Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990. As of 2021,
        the population of Africa is estimated at 1.4 billion. Africa's total
        population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population
        surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime 
        around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to 
        overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at 
        roughly the same time â€“ India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap 
        ranking around the year 2022.[184] This increase in number of babies born in 
        Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 
        37% in the year 2050, an increase of 21% since 1990 alone.</p>
