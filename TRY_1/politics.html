      <p>The African Union (AU) is a continental union consisting of 55 member states.
        The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters,
        on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002 as a 
        successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, 
        the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, 
        in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights 
        remained in Addis Ababa..</p>
