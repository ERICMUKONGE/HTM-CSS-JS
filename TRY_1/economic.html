      <h1>ECONOMICS</h1>
      <p>Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's 
        poorest and least-developed continent (other than Antarctica), 
        the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments 
        that have often committed serious human rights violations, 
        failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, low self-esteem, 
        lack of access to foreign capital, legacies of colonialism, the slave trade, 
        and the Cold War, and frequent tribal and military conflict 
        (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide). Its total nominal GDP remains
        behind that of the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom,
        India and France. According to the United Nations' Human Development Report 
        in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.</p>
